## Predicting brain cancer by identifying homogenous gene expressions

### Description:  
This project will train models to predict brain cancer in patients based on gene expressions.
For some models, feature engineering and selection will be vital. For others, like nearest shrunken neighbor, we could attempt the use of the entire dataset, as this model is best suited for high dimensional data with low sample size.

### Name of Selected Dataset: 
Brain cancer gene selection 

### Description of Selected Dataset: 
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brunogrisci/brain-cancer-gene-expression-cumida.

The data contains 130 instances with over 50k features of genetic data. The dependent variable is multinomial, with 4 classes of cancer types, and 1 class of normal.
